Add in the bag of marshmallows and stir everything over low heat until the marshmallows are melted. The sauce should be smooth and blended. Remove the pan from the heat.. Add in the crisped rice cereal. Use the buttered spatula to stir and coat the cereal with the marshmallow mixture. Spread half of the marshmallow-cereal mixture in the bottom and to the edges of the prepared pan: I find it easiest to do this with buttered hands but you can also use the buttered spatula. Sprinkle the 4 packages of Pop Rocks in an even layer over the cereal. If you are using purple sprinkles you can add them here as well.

Invert the contents of the pan onto a serving dish. The square should be cooled and set. Assemble the piping bag and #6 tip and have it ready to fill.
